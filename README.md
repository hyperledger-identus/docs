## Installation

Here are the simple installation instructions for MacOS to start from the very scratch.

```shell
# Install brew, git, node and yarn
# If you have these tools, skip these steps
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install git
brew install node
brew install yarn

# Create new projects directory
cd ~ && mkdir projects && cd projects
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger-identus/docs.git
# Initialize submodules
git submodule init
# Update submodules
git submodule update --remote --recursive

# Use this step to checkout custom branch to review from PR
# git checkout feature-branch

# Deploy local version of the website
cd docs
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```
$ yarn build --out-dir infra/website
```

This command creates a set of static resources which can be hosted to serve the full site.

## Run [linkinator](https://github.com/JustinBeckwith/linkinator) locally to check the broken links of the live website

```shell
$ npx linkinator https://hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs/ --config .linkinatorrc.json --format text
```
