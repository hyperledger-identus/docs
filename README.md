# Identus documentation website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

# Structure

The `documentation` folder is split into the following parts:
* `docs`
* `tutorials`
* `sdk`
* `api`

## `docs`: general documentation

`documentation/docs` is a general documentation directory for:
* Getting started guides
* SSI and Identus concepts
* Identus architecture and components description

## `tutorials`: general Identus tutorials

`documentation/tutorials`  directory assigned to contain all tutorials about essential topics and protocols Identus is supported, for example:
* Credential issuance
* Verification
* DIDs
* etc.

## `sdk`: SDKs documentation

`documentation/sdk` is a special directory for SDK documentation, user guides, and examples. There are two subfolders:
* `enterprise-sdk`: for what we call now "Enterprise SDK"
* `wallet-sdk`: for what we call now "Wallet SDK"

## `api`: autogenerated docs from OpenAPI specs

`documentation/api` directory contains auto-generated documentation for RestAPI endpoints provided by Identus executables, it's auto-generated and should not be added manually.

## Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```
$ yarn build --out-dir infra/website

This command creates a set of static resources which can be hosted to serve the full site.
