# Tutorials

Welcome to the **Atala PRISM Ecosystem** Tutorials!

These tutorials will help you get started with Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and using Atala PRISM.
The tutorials will guide you through setting up a connection, working with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and using verifiable credentials.

Whether you are new to SSI or have some prior experience, these tutorials will provide you with the necessary information and skills to build and use SSI-based applications.
