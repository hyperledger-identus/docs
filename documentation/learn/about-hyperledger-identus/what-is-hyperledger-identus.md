# What is Hyperledger Identus

Hyperledger Identus (henceforth, Identus) is an application platform that provides a comprehensive and innovative toolset for building decentralized identity systems, using a distributed ledger as a verifiable data registry (VDR). This toolset facilitates the creation and management of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and supports the issuance, updating, and revocation of verifiable credentials. With this technology, users can securely and efficiently manage their digital identities while ensuring the integrity and authenticity of their credentials.

Identus is built upon Self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles, empowering users to selectively disclose their data. With SSI, users retain full control of their digital identity.

**Supported standards**

Identus is built on industry-standard protocols and specifications to ensure interoperability and compliance with the broader SSI ecosystem:

* W3C DID Specification  
* DIDComm v2  
* W3C VC-JWT  
* Hyperledger Anoncreds  
* OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance.

## What you'll learn {#what-you'll-learn}

This Learn section will guide you through understanding  Identus, from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations. 

**Learning path overview**

Begin with the **Basic concepts** section to understand the fundamental principles of decentralized identity. Then explore the **Advanced explainers** for a deeper exploration of the ecosystem components. 

The content assumes basic familiarity with digital identity concepts but explains all SSI-specific terminology. Follow the links to the glossary for detailed definitions throughout the documentation.
