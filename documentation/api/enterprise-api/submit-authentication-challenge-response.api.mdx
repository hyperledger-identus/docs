## Public endpoint to which holders submit challenge responses



When submitted, signed challenge is verified against the authentication 
key found in DID document of a DID used to sign the challenge. Any 
request to this endpoint would invalidate particular authentication 
session. If invalid request is submitted, challenge state would 
transition to `error` state.

Both `did` and `signature` size is limited to maximum of 1000 characters.
Signature should be `base64Url` encoded, and only `did:peer` is supported
up to date.
