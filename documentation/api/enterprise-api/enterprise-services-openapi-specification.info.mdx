# Enterprise Services OpenAPI specification



Enterprise Services complements basic services offered by the Prism Agent. 
Currently two products are part of this suite: __Onboard__ and 
__Authenticate__.

__Onboard product__ enables organisations to request and get a DID from 
another party. It is about onboarding people towards SSI based systems. The 
process happens out-of-band, meaning no DIDComm messaging is utilised. 
Acquired DID could be used to trigger various SSI based services such as 
authentication with DID.

Onboard flow:

* Inviting party creates a DID request.
* DID request is encoded, usually as a QR code or deep link, and sent to the
other party over appropriate channel depending on the use case. 
* Receiving party uses their wallet to scan/receive DID request.
* New DID is created by the wallet and sent back to the `onboardEndpoint` 
stated in DID request.
* Inviting party binds received did with its system context, ie. with userId

__Authenticate product__ enables authenticating users and things based on 
DIDs they control. This product offers APIs to create and track the state of 
an authentication challenge, which is sent to an authenticating party.

Authenticate flow:
* Authentication challenge is created.
* Challenge is encoded and sent to the other party over appropriate channel 
depending on the use case. 
* Party which receives the challenge, needs to sign the `nonce` and to submit 
`signature` and `did` containing corresponding authentication public key to 
the `submissionEndpoint` for verification.
* Signature is verified and challenge state is updated accordingly.
* Application can check if submitted signature is valid and if used did is 
known, and act upon it. 

Authentication challenge session is time constrained and has defined 
expiration time.

Application has to acquire a DID and to bind it to its system context before 
or during authentication flow. Onboard product could be used for that purpose.

Wallets could use `did:peer` and `did:prism` for the time being.
