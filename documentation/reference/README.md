### 🏗️ Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

Documentation of key architectural decisions made during the development of Hyperledger Identus. ADRs provide:

- **Context** - The circumstances and forces at play when decisions were made
- **Decision** - The architectural choice and its rationale
- **Consequences** - Expected outcomes and trade-offs

ADRs help developers understand the "why" behind technical choices and maintain consistency across the platform.
