## A

## B

## C
### claim
An assertion made about a subject.

## D
### decentralized identifier
A globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized registration authority and is often cryptographically generated. All DIDs use distributed ledger technology (DLT) or some other decentralized network.

### DID
See [decentralized identifier](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#decentralized-identifer)

### DID document
A set of data that describes the DID subject, including mechanisms such as cryptographic public keys. The entire W3C DID specification is [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/).

### DID method
The DID method defines how to implement a specific DID method schema. The specification defines the DID method, including precise operations to create DIDs and [DID documents](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#did-document) and how to resolve, update, and deactivate them.

### DID subject
The entity is identified by a [DID](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#decentralized-identifer) and described by a [DID documents](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#did-document). Anything can be a DID subject: person, group, organization, physical thing, digital thing, etc.

### distributed ledger technology (DLT)
A distributed database or ledger establishes confidence for the participants to rely on the data recorded. Typically these databases use nodes and a consensus protocol to confirm the order of cryptographically signed transactions. Linking the transactions over time creates a historical ledger that is effectively immutable.

## E
### endpoints
A network address at which services operate on behalf of a [DID subject](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#did-subject).

## F

## G
### governance framework
See [Trust Framework](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#trust-framework)


## H
### holder
An entity will take on this role by possessing one or more [verifiable credentials](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#verifiable-credentials) and generating [verifiable presentations](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#verifiable-presentations).

## I
### invitation

### invitee

### inviter

### issuer
An entity that asserts claim(s) about one or more [subjects](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#did-subject) then creates a [verifiable credentials](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#verifiable-credentials) from these claims and transmits the VC to a holder.
