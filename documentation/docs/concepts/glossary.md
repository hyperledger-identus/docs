# Glossary

## A

## B

## C
### claim
An assertion made about a [subject](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#did-subject).

## D
### decentralized identifier
A globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized registration authority and is often cryptographically generated. All DIDs use distributed ledger technology (DLT) or some other decentralized network.

### DID
See [decentralized identifier](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#decentralized-identifer)

### DID document
A set of data that describes the DID subject, including mechanisms such as cryptographic public keys. The entire W3C DID specification is [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/).

### DID method
The DID method defines how to implement a specific DID method schema. The specification defines the DID method, including precise operations to create DIDs and [DID documents](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#did-document) and how to resolve, update, and deactivate them.

### DID subject
The entity is identified by a [DID](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#decentralized-identifer) and described by a [DID documents](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#did-document). Anything can be a DID subject: person, group, organization, physical thing, digital thing, etc.

### distributed ledger technology (DLT)
A distributed database or ledger establishes confidence for the participants to rely on the data recorded. Typically these databases use nodes and a consensus protocol to confirm the order of cryptographically signed transactions. Linking the transactions over time creates a historical ledger that is effectively immutable.

## E
### endpoints
A network address at which services operate on behalf of a [DID subject](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#did-subject).

## F

## G
### governance framework
See [Trust Framework](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#trust-framework)


## H
### holder
An entity will take on this role by possessing one or more [verifiable credentials](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#verifiable-credentials) and generating [verifiable presentations](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#verifiable-presentations).

## I
### invitation

### invitee

### inviter

### issuer
An entity that asserts claim(s) about one or more [subjects](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#did-subject) then creates a [verifiable credentials](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#verifiable-credentials) from these claims and transmits the VC to a holder.

### proof
A cryptographic mechanism that proves the information in a [verifiable credential](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#verifiable-credentials) or [verifiable presentation](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#verifiable-presentation) has not been tampered with. Many types of cryptographic proofs include but are not limited to digital signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, Proofs of Work, and Proofs of Stake.

### verifiable credential (VC)
A verifiable credential is a tamper-evident credential that contains one or more claims made by an issuer whose authorship can be cryptographically verified. It is possible to use VCs to create a [verifiable presentation](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#verifiable-presentation). Also, the claims in a VC can be about different subjects.

### verifiable presentation
Data is derived from one or more [verifiable credentials](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#verifiable-credential), issued by issuers, and shared (presented) to a specific verifier. The verifiable presentation is tamper-evident and encoded in a way to trust the authorship of the data after a cryptographic verification. 


### verifier
An entity that receives one or more [verifiable credentials](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#verifiable-credential) optionally, inside a [verifiable presentation](/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#verifiable-presentation). Also known as a relying party.
