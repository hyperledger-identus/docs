# Digital wallets

Many discussions are still ongoing about what is a digital wallet. Still, there is some universal agreement: A digital wallet consists of software (optionally hardware) that enables the wallet's controller to generate, store, manage, and protect cryptographic keys, secrets, and other sensitive private data as verifiable credentials.

Other sensitive private data is as varied as what people keep in their physical wallets or purses, such as:

* DIDs
* Verifiable credentials
* Digital copies of physical documents (i.e., PDF of a passport)
* Business cards
* Resumes, CVs
* Usernames and passwords (i.e., password manager)
* Currency, including cryptocurrencies and digital tokens

A digital agent (software) exists inside a wallet, allowing users to take actions, communicate, store info, and track usage. The agent works with the wallet to ensure functionality and a seamless user experience. To learn more about how the PRISM Agent works, refer to the PRISM Agent section.


## User Experience

Communication with contacts, whether friends, professionals, or customer relationships, should be familiar. A large portion of the population is non-technical. Most will need help understanding how to make a secure invitation to a new contact, create a verifiable presentation, or verify a credential. The wallet is the most critical thing to get right in your customer's hands because no one will use it if it's wrong.

There is a serious need for user experience and design with digital wallets, especially those that support identity. The experience using decentralized identity with decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) should be as good today, if not better. For example, the experience of using single-sign-on (SSO) should be as seamless or better when using a DID.
