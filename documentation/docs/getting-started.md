# Getting Started

Atala PRISM is a toolset that provides infrastructure for decentralized identity. It is a layer-2 blockchain solution that leverages the Cardano blockchain as a [verifiable data registry (VDR)](/docs/concepts/glossary#verifiable-data-registry). PRISM's roots are in [self-sovereign identity (SSI)](/docs/concepts/glossary#self-sovereign-identity), which empowers users to control their identity and personal information, including selectively disclosing with whom to share their data using asymmetric cryptography.

The documentation herein will explain the following:

* The concepts of SSI
* How PRISM works
