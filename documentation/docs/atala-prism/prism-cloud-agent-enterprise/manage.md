# Manage

> Coming soon!

ManageUI is an intuitive web application designed to simplify the management of 
Atala PRISM's suite of products, which enable the creation of applications with
SSI-based features. With ManageUI, users can easily configure and integrate 
PRISM products without the need for any coding. Initially, ManageUI will allow 
users to create and manage credential schemas, as well as verification policies.
While ManageUI is currently in development, it is set to launch soon.
