# Manage

> Coming soon!

ManageUI is an intuitive web application designed to simplify the management of
Atala PRISM's suite of products, which enables the creation of applications with
SSI-based features. With ManageUI, users can easily configure and integrate
PRISM products without the need for any coding. Initially, ManageUI will allow
users to create and manage credential schemas and verification policies.
While ManageUI is currently in development, it will be launching soon.
