# Overview

The Atala PRISM offering comprises the following core components:

- PRISM Cloud Agent, a fully featured cloud agent used for interacting with other agents in the realm of Self-Sovereign-Identity (SSI) in a standards-based and interoperable way
- A *Verifiable Data Registry* (VDR) provides on-chain persistence using the Cardano blockchain.
- PRISM Cloud Agent Enterprise - built on top of the fully featured PRISM Cloud Agent as its foundation, providing additional capabilities and enterprise-ready business controller logic

Atala offers a hosted service for PRISM, which provides a dedicated - single-tenant instance - powered by the above components.

Atala builds its services using a set of functionally decomposed building blocks which are re-usable libraries with strong domain context bounds.
