These tutorials will help you get started with using Identus Platform. The tutorials will guide you through setting up a connection, working with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and using verifiable credentials. Whether you are new to self-sovereign identity (SSI) or have prior experience, these tutorials will provide the necessary information and skills to build and use SSI-based applications. Throughout all code examples in tutorials, the following conventions are in use: Issuer Keycloak is hosted at http://localhost:9980/Issuer Agent is hosted at http://localhost:8080/cloud-agent/Holder Agent is hosted at http://localhost:8090/cloud-agent/Verifier Agent is hosted at http://localhost:8100/cloud-agent/ To use the Identus Cloud Agents, you must include an apiKey header in your requests. You can configure the key, and in some instances, it will be provided to you, so make sure to create an environment variable with the proper value. export API_KEY=&lt;API Key value&gt; Alternatively, replace $API_KEY with your key in the CURL commands supplied throughout this tutorial. :::","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Delete the Credential Definition","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/cloud-agent/docs/docusaurus/credentialdefinition/delete","content":"Delete the Credential Definition Unfortunately, once published (especially in the Verifiable Data Registry (VDR), deleting the credential definition becomes unfeasible. In the Identus Platform, credential definitions aren't published to the VDR. This functionality will be incorporated in subsequent versions of the platform. Hence, the platform currently doesn't provide a REST API for deletion. If you need to delete the credential definition, it's advisable to contact the database administrator or directly remove it from the Postgres instance using its guid.

If the DID Controller updates the DID before the previous update is confirmed, it can create a situation where the sequence of updates splits into two separate paths, which is not allowed according to the protocol. This happens because the Cloud Agent connects the update operation to the latest confirmed update. Once the pending update operation is confirmed, any other pending operation that does not link to the latest confirmed operation will be discarded. The subsequent updates continuing from that operation will also be discarded. However, the Cloud Agent has a safeguard in place to prevent this issue by rejecting multiple updates submitted on the same DID while previous updates are still being processed.

For flexibility in defining custom policy and permission models, administrators can manually create these UMA resources (resource, policy, permission) directly on Keycloak using a set of UMA endpoints called Protection API (see Keycloak Protection API). However, using Protection API to manage permissions is out of the scope of this tutorial.  Once the registration is successful, the tenant can obtain an ID token from Keycloak using any available OIDC flow, such as the direct access grants (username &amp; password). This ID token typically contains user claims such as username and subject ID. The tenant can use Keycloak's token endpoint to convert this token to an RPT (requesting party token), another token containing permissions information.

This choice is deemed suitable for production because all data is encrypted and it also offers additional security-related capabilities. By default, the agent uses this backend but the option is configurable. To utilize this backend, set the SECRET_STORAGE_BACKEND variable to vault.  Authentication and Authorization  The agent expects to read and write secrets to the path /secret/*, so ensure the appropriate permissions are provisioned.  Example Vault policy  path &quot;secret/*&quot; { capabilities = [&quot;create&quot;, &quot;read&quot;, &quot;update&quot;, &quot;patch&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;list&quot;] }   HashiCorp Vault provides multiple authentication methods. One of the simplest methods is token authentication. To authenticate using the token, set the environment variable VAULT_TOKEN. The agent prefers token authentication if provided with multiple authentication methods.  Another method is AppRole authentication which is suitable for automatic workflows. To use AppRole authentication, set the environment variable VAULT_APPROLE_ROLE_ID and VAULT_APPROLE_SECRET_ID.  Storage Backend  HashiCorp Vault supports multiple backends for storage, such as filesystem, Etcd, PostgreSQL, or Integrated Storage (Raft). Each backend has different properties, which have implications for how secrets can be stored. The agent logically stores secrets in the following hierarchies.  # Wallet seed /secret/&lt;wallet-id&gt;/seed # Peer DID keys /secret/&lt;wallet-id&gt;/dids/peer/&lt;peer-did&gt;/keys/&lt;key-id&gt; # Generic secrets /secret/&lt;wallet-id&gt;/generic-secrets/&lt;specific-path&gt;   Each storage backend has certain limitations, such as size, number of sub-paths, or path length. Some backends can support path lengths of up to 32,768 characters, while others only allow a few hundred characters. In some cases, the storage backends might not support the above logical convention due to excessively long paths.  To address this issue, the agent supports path shortening. This feature can be toggled by setting the environment variable VAULT_USE_SEMANTIC_PATH=false. When it is disabled, the unbounded portion of the path will be replaced by a SHA-256 digest of the original relative path. Additionally, the original path will be stored in the secret metadata.

To enable this option, set the SECRET_STORAGE_BACKEND to postgres, and it will utilize the same database configuration as the agent's database.

Given that the Cloud Agent employs BIP32, it expects a 64-byte binary seed as input. Various methods exist for generating a byte sequence, each serving different purposes.  The Cloud Agent does not have any opinion on how the seed should be generated as long as a valid hex string is provided. However, it is strongly recommended to use high entropy for generating the master seed.

Backend services: Identus Cloud Agent, Identus Mediator, and PRISM Node use PostgreSQL.  Doobie library is currently used in Scala code to communicate with Postgresql. Quotes from the website  Doobie is a pure functional JDBC layer for Scala and Cats. It is not an ORM, nor is it a relational algebra; it simply provides a functional way to construct programs (and higher-level libraries) that use JDBC doobie is a Typelevel project. This means we embrace pure, typeful, functional programming, and provide a safe and friendly environment for teaching, learning, and contributing as described in the Scala Code of Conduct.   Doobie is a good choice for DAL, and this ADR is about something other than replacing it.  Writing the SQL statement and mapping the row to the case class is a boilerplate and error-prone activity that the Quill library can optimize.  Writing the code for mapping a table row to a case class and writing the low-level SQL statement is an error-prone and boilerplate thing  Using the Quill library on top of Doobie can optimize and improve these things.Quote from the website:  Quill provides a Quoted Domain Specific Language (QDSL) to express queries in Scala and execute them in a target language. The library’s core is designed to support multiple target languages, currently featuring specializations for Structured Query Language (SQL) and Cassandra Query Language (CQL). 1. Boilerplate-free mapping: The database schema is mapped using simple case classes. 2. Quoted DSL: Queries are defined inside a quote block. Quill parses each quoted block of code (quotation) at compile time and translates them to an internal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) 3. Compile-time query generation: The ctx.run call reads the quotation’s AST and translates it to the target language at compile time, emitting the query string as a compilation message. As the query string is known at compile time, the runtime overhead is very low and similar to using the database driver directly. 4. Compile-time query validation: If configured, the query is verified against the database at compile time, and the compilation fails if it is not valid. The query validation does not alter the database state.   There are Slick and ScalikeJDBC libraries as well.  Comparison of these libraries is not a goal of this ADR, but it's essential to know the differences.  There are good references to take a look at in the Links section.  Overall, all libraries have differences in the following aspects:  Metamodel (how to define the schema and type mapping)Static SQL statement (how and where does the SQL statement is written/generated)Dynamic SQL statement (how and where does the dynamic SQL statement written/generated)Connection Management (thread and connection pooling)Asynchronous API (the high-level API to execute queries blocking or non-blocking)Asynchronous IO (is IO operation blocking or asynchronous)Effect library that is used (free-monad, Future, Task, ZIO)  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Decision Drivers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Quill library for SQL statement generation and validation","url":"/docs/documentation/adrs/decisions/2023-01-18-quill-library-for-sql-statement-generation#decision-drivers","content":" Generate and validate SQL statement based on the convention-over-configuration approach in compile time (type-safe queries)Reduce boilerplate and error-prone codeEasy to write the dynamic queries  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Considered Options​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Quill library for SQL statement generation and validation","url":"/docs/documentation/adrs/decisions/2023-01-18-quill-library-for-sql-statement-generation#considered-options","content":" Doobie (Quill for the connection pooling, SQL statement execution, and SQL statement writing)Doobie + Quill (Quill for the connection pooling, SQL statement execution, and SQL statement writing + Quill for the SQL statement generation)Quill (Quill for the connection pooling, SQL statement execution, and SQL statement writing and generation)  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Decision Outcome​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Quill library for SQL statement generation and validation","url":"/docs/documentation/adrs/decisions/2023-01-18-quill-library-for-sql-statement-generation#decision-outcome","content":" Chosen option: &quot;Doobie + Quill&quot; because it's the simplest solution that requires minimal changes to the existing code and brings the benefits of automatic SQL statement generation and validation in compile time (see below).

The decision was made by team consensus during the first AOH meeting to follow &quot;OpenAPI specification first&quot; approach and generate stubs, server side and client side code based on OAS. Following this strategy we currently have 4-5 OAS files (Castor, Pollux, Mercury, Configuration).  The following tool was selected for code generation: OpenAPI Tools  Instead of using the yaml file as OpenAPI specification and openapi-generator for server and client stub generation - this ADR proposes to use Tapir Scala library as DSL for OpenAPI specification, interpret the endpoint defitions as Scala server and client stub, generate the yaml file, and use openapi-generator for client stubs.  Technology stack that is going to be used in the Identus platform backend: Scala 3 + ZIO ecosystem  Akka framework after version 2.6.x cannot be used because Lightbend changed the license type to BSL 1.1.  Looks like Akka 2.6.x still can be used according to License FQA  Currently, we have a code generation for Akka that is wrapped up into ZIO. Code generation mustache templates for ZIO-http are not available in OpenAPI tools.  Mustache templates and code generation doesn't work out of the box, so the original templates where copied to the project and fixed by @Shota and @Pat. Current templates and generator contains constraints that were reported by @Pat and @Shota, this requires engineering time to adopt the OAS for a code generation. @Ben says that we can live with these constraints  Generally, OAS files are written by the engineers with different experience and different view on formatting, schemas, normalization, datatype. For instance, in current templates don't have  a consistent way for paginating the entitiesstandard Responses for 4xx and 5xx errorsnormalized data types (we use anyOf, allOf)query parameters convention for filtering the entitiessome data types are duplicated in both Castor and Pollux OAS  As OAS specification evolves it's getting harder to manage it because of the size of the file. To mitigate this issue @Pat proposed to use well-known tools: &quot;Knowing that there are tools like dhall or CUE that allow us to write large configuration in yaml (or json) in a typesafe / reuseable way, I'm not hesitant to go contract-first.&quot;(c)  Quality and formatting of autogenerated code depend on the template (not all templates are good enough).

SQL is used in PostgreSQL to save, retrieve, access, and manipulate the database data. While PostgreSQL may be ideal for managing structured data streams, it tends to struggle when dealing with big unstructured data, as maintaining such relations can increase time complexity significantly. Postgres SQL relies on relational data models that need to defined in advance Change in any field in table requires lengthy process of migration scripts run and to maintain but it works there are tools available and we also use it PrismAgent, But maintenance cost of software is higher.  Contrastingly, non-relational databases like MongoDB excel in these scenarios because data isn't constrained to a single table. This approach permits massive data streams to be imported directly into the system without the burden of setting up increasingly complex relationships and keys. MongoDB typically stores data within documents using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or BSON (Binary JavaScript Object Notation), which simplifies the handling of big data and complex data streams. document database supports a rapid, iterative cycle of development the way that a document database turns data into code. MongoDB is faster at inserting and for queries that use nested references instead of joins In Mediator the data which we send or receive is json message and to process json message we can avoid the unnecessary serialization and deserialization by having it stored in document database.

The solution is limited to storing AnonCreds entities only but can be extended to store the general resources.  For more details, please refer to the source code.  As the solution is based on the latest ToIP specification, it derives all positive and negative consequences from the previous but contains the concrete implementation for the Cardano blockchain that solves the trust and longevity aspects of the technical solution.  Positive Consequences​  interoperability: the resource is resolved in a standard way according to the ToIP specification following W3C specification for DID URL dereferencingdiscoverability: the resource metadata is published in the DID Documenttrust &amp; longevity: is guaranteed by the underlying Cardano blockchaintechnology stack: the solution is leveraging Blockfrost REST API for communicating with the Cardano blockchaintechnology stack: the solution is stateless and is much cheaper in terms of the infrastructure costtechnology stack: the solution is implemented in Python and TypeScript (mobile platforms can use the same approach as well)  Negative Consequences​  scalability: the specification is inspired by the Cheqd approach to store the linkedResourceMetadata inside of the DID Documentthe convention for references and the logic must be carefully reviewed: schemaId in this solution is {didRef}/resources/{cardano_transaction_id}, so it doesn't refer to the id but to the Tx where everything else is stored (it's an interesting idea for a stateless design)resource metadata is built according to the ToIP specification but for AnonCreds entities only: credential schema and credential definition. technology stack: it doesn't fit to current platform, but can be used for inspiration.

An example of this solution will be the following (concerning the current infrastructure and services):  prism-node must be able to store the generic resource payload, signature and/or hash on-chain and restore the given resource in the underlying database (PostgreSQL) for indexing and lookup APIcredential schema (or any other resource module) must be a part of the Atala SSI infrastructure and allow publishing the concrete resource as a generic resource using the prism-node APIexpose the API for discovery and fetching the resource by URLexpose the API for managing the resources (create, publish, lookup with pagination) the Universal Resolver for the DID Method must be able to discover and fetch the resource by DID URLis needed, SDK and backend services can fetch the resources directly (not via the Universal Resolver)  Example:  Given the credential schema with the signature:  { &quot;$id&quot;: &quot;driving-license-1.0&quot;, &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Driving License&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: { &quot;credentialSubject&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: { &quot;emailAddress&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;email&quot; }, &quot;givenName&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot; }, &quot;familyName&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot; }, &quot;dateOfIssuance&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;datetime&quot; }, &quot;drivingLicenseID&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot; }, &quot;drivingClass&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot; }, &quot;required&quot;: [ &quot;emailAddress&quot;, &quot;familyName&quot;, &quot;dateOfIssuance&quot;, &quot;drivingLicenseID&quot;, &quot;drivingClass&quot; ], &quot;additionalProperties&quot;: true } } }, &quot;proof&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;RsaSignature2018&quot;, &quot;created&quot;: &quot;2023-04-18T10:30:00Z&quot;, &quot;jws&quot;: &quot;eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vY3JlZGVudGlhbHMvc3ViamVjdCIsInR5cGUiOiJWZXJpZmljYWxpY0NyZWRlbnRpYWwiLCJpc3N1ZXIiOiJodHRwczovL2V4YW1wbGUuY29tL2lzc3VlciIsImlzc3VlckRhdGUiOiIyMDIzLTA0LTE4VDEwOjMwOjAwWiIsImV4cGlyYXRpb25EYXRlIjoiMjAyNC0wNC0xOFQxMDowOTo1MFoiLCJjcmVkZW50aWFsU3ViamVjdCI6eyJpZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vY3JlZGVudGlhbHMvc3ViamVjdC9zdWJqZWN0IiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwic2lnbmF0dXJlIjoxMH19.OesuS6eC0gVh8SZpESM7Z4Yln9sGSsJHQ8s0LlcsD99H6_7U6vukUeT2_GZTtuTf9SwIfdtgViFTOfhzGTyM6oMGEeUJv6Umlh6TQ1fTm9XEDQV7JDBiaxRzV7S_vS6i&quot;, &quot;alg&quot;: &quot;RS256&quot; } }   In order to store it as a general resource on-chain, it should be binary encoded into CBOR format (or Base64 encoded string) and the metadata must be added to it.  For example, it might look like the following JSON object:  { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;f3d39687-69f5-4046-a960-3aae86a0d3ca&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;DrivingLicense-1.0&quot;, &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;CredentialSchema&quot;, &quot;mediaType&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;, // MIME Type of the resource &quot;data&quot;: &quot;SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxk&quot;, // base 64 encoded or CBOR file &quot;did&quot;: &quot;did:prism:abdcefg&quot;, // the DID reference to link the resource to the DID and create the anchor to the DID }   ... and published on the Cardano blockchain as a payload of the AtalaOperation object, so can be retrieved from the blockchain and added to the indexed database for resolution by the REST API  Given there is an Agent or CredentialSchema service that exposes the REST API for fetching the credential schema by ID (in the current implementation it corresponds to the Cloud Agent /schema-registry/credential-schema/{uuid}, but later might be changed to /credential-schema/{didRef}/{id}?version={version} )  So, the services of the Identus platform and SDKs can resolve the given schema by URL and use the convenient lookup API with filtering and pagination to manage the credential schema in the Web application.  To define the schemaId in the message of Issue Credential and Present Proof protocols the following DID URL can be used:  did:prism:abcdefg1234567890?service=credentialschema&amp;relativeRef=%2Ff3d39687-69f5-4046-a960-3aae86a0d3ca   The version is skipped as for resolving the single resource we don't need a version parameterf3d39687-69f5-4046-a960-3aae86a0d3ca - is a unique identifier that is derived from the triple: didRef, id and version.  So, having the following service endpoint definition in the DID Document:  { &quot;service&quot;: [ { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;did:prism:abcdefg#credentialschema&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;CredentialSchemaService&quot;, &quot;serviceEndpoint&quot;: &quot;https://agent.example.com/schema-registry/schemas&quot; } ] }   And having the logic for dereferencing the DID URL in the PRISM DID Resolver, any system in the SSI ecosystem can fetch this resource and validate its authorship.  Storing resources larger than 64KB is out of the scope of this ADR. These must be stored in a slightly different way, for instance, the image ~10MB, can be stored and linked to the DID Document in the following way:  the image is stored in the cloud database in a binary formatthe metadata and the hash of the image are stored on-chainoptionally, the signature of the owner DID can be generated for the payload and stored together with the hashto prove the integrity of the image file, the hash of the binary representation must be the same and/or the signature must be verifiedthe resource can be fetched in the same way and the credential schema from the previous example  Positive Consequences​  discoverability: the credential schema or any other resource is discovered using the Universal Resolverscalability: the size of DID document doesn't grow when a new resource is added, the number of the resources is limited by the scalability of the underlying database and the blockchainlongevity: for the resource that can be stored on-chain the longevity is 100% guaranteed by the underlying blockchain technologytrust: is achieved by cryptography and the underlying blockchain technology, the transaction with the resource contains the hashes and the signatures that can be verifiedinteroperability: any system that uses Universal Resolver can fetch the resource by dereferencing the DID URL (following the W3C specification)vendor lock: by publishing the specifications and the algorithms for fetching the data, the resource can be resolved by any other SSI system  Negative Consequences​  longevity: for the resource that can not be stored on-chain because of the large size longevity is guaranteed by the cloud recovery procedures and data backup. As an option for mitigating this problem, the resource can be stored in IPFS (additional ADR is required for this)vendor lock: the solution is coupled to the Cardano blockchain  NOTE: one of the main concerns of this ADR is storing the resources on-chain because of size limitation, throughput, latency and cost. This option allows to postpone this decision and implement the DID-linked resources without the need of storing resources on-chain.

This can be achieved through logical partitions, such as separate databases, schemas, tables or Row Security Policies (RSP in the PostgreSQL) Physical Separation: In addition to logical separation, physical separation can provide an extra layer of isolation. This involves segregating tenants' data into separate physical resources, such as servers, storage devices, or networks. Physical separation helps prevent data leakage or unauthorized access between tenants.  Logical and Physical Separations define the level of isolation for storage, connection pool, and computation resources: CPU, RAM, and Disk I/0.  Access Controls: Robust access controls should be implemented to restrict access to each tenant's data. This includes authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of users or applications accessing the data and authorization rules to define what actions they are allowed to perform. Each tenant's access should be limited to their data and not extend beyond their boundaries. Data Encryption: To protect data at rest and in transit, encryption techniques should be employed. This ensures that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains unreadable without the appropriate decryption keys. Encryption can be applied at various levels, including the application, database, or file system. Data encryption at rest and in transit is a matter of infrastructure configuration and shouldn't play a significant role in the following ADR. Tenant-Specific Configuration: Each tenant may have specific configuration requirements, such as custom data schemas, access controls, or data retention policies. The system should allow for flexible configuration options to accommodate these individual tenant needs while maintaining isolation. For simplification, in the scope of the following ADR, all tenants will not have the custom configuration, but it can be implemented by having one of the following physical separations, such as separated schemas or instances of the database. Auditing and Logging: Comprehensive logging and auditing mechanisms should be in place to track and monitor access to tenants' data. This helps in detecting any unauthorized activities or potential breaches and provides an audit trail for forensic analysis if needed. Auditing and Logging should provide visibility if the tenant tried to access the data that don't belong to it and the basic statistic to determine resource unitisation by the tenant (requests/sec, request latency). Data Backup and Recovery: Robust data backup and recovery processes should be implemented to ensure the availability and integrity of tenants' data. Regular backups should be taken and securely stored, with mechanisms in place to restore data in the event of data loss or system failures. The current aspect corresponds to the SRE area and will not be taken into account in the following ADR and can be guaranteed by the infrastructure layer. Performance and Scalability: Data isolation mechanisms should be designed to minimize performance impacts and provide scalability. The architecture should be able to handle increasing numbers of tenants and their data without sacrificing performance or compromising isolation. The Complexity of the Implementation: It's essential to build the multi-tenancy capability for the Identus platform without the introduction of unnecessary complexity at the application layer, operation layer, and maintenance, in a way that allows evolving the platform naturally along with the growth of the users, scalability requirements, and real business needs.

A single instance of the PostgreSQL database can keep the data and handle requests of hundreds of thousands of tenants leveraging the Row Security Policies without additional operation and infrastructure costs.  At the same time, the Cloud Agent architecture can support Instance per Tenant or Database per Tenant configuration by isolating the DAL under the repository interface. So, these options also can be considered for organizations with a lot of tenants to provide better isolation and data protection guarantees. These two options are excellent for a group of tenants under a single organisation or can be considered for tenants that require geographical separation of data, but should not be used for a single tenant.  Moreover, for the SaaS application to manage thousands of organizations and millions of tenants, the Row Security Policies option will not be enough because of the resource limitations and amount of requests to the database. In this case, one of the PostgreSQL sharding options is required together with Row Security Policies. So, either Citus extension or Amazon RDS sharding should be used. Citus extension is a preferred way for an on-premise environment, but, it probably, can be used in AWS as well.

An agent can support a single-tenant only.  Each single-tenant agent is accessed via a shared API gateway layer (APISIX) that enforces a consumer restriction list. Only assigned consumers, identified through the pre-shared key, can access specific agent instances.  This authentication/authorisation mechanism poses a significant security risk. If the pre-shared key is leaked, we lack the means to detect its misuse by a nefarious actor, as there is no proof-of-possession mechanism or additional authentication factor in place.  In our Multi-tenant Value Brief, we propose modifications to the agent, enabling it to host multiple tenants within a single instance. Here, a tenant is defined as a unique set of private keys and configurations shared by multiple API consumers.  As we transition to multi-tenancy, several critical questions emerge:  How should the Cloud Agent authenticate, or verify the identities of, its API consumers?How should the Cloud Agent authorise a particular identity to use a specific instance of the agent?As the Cloud Agent becomes capable of hosting multiple tenants whose workloads must remain isolated, how should it become tenant-aware?

A significant additional advantage of our chosen framework, particularly for the JavaScript version of this library, is the future potential to export to WebAssembly (WASM).

This library will meet our defined requirements and strategically position us for future technological advancements.  2.1 Provable Security​  Our cryptographic library will provide engineers with high assurances of security. This will be accomplished by using cryptographic primitives that are secure, with this security being provable through rigorous mathematical proofs. Documentation will accompany these proofs to offer transparency and enable a deeper understanding of the underlying logic and assurances.  2.2 Centralized Cryptography Management​  We propose the creation of a cryptographic library that serves as the central management hub for all cryptographic operations within the Identus platform. By preventing &quot;DIY&quot; implementations, we decrease potential vulnerabilities and establish a standard, thus enhancing overall security across our organization.  2.3 Easy Upgrade Path​  In light of emerging cryptographic needs such as the introduction of quantum-resistant cryptography, our library will be designed with easy upgrades in mind. Its modular design will allow for the seamless introduction of new cryptographic primitives as they become necessary or advisable. This adaptability will ensure that cryptographic upgrades across all of Identus' components are consistent and efficient.  2.4 Code Reusability​  Our library will make the most of Kotlin Multiplatform's capabilities for code reuse across different platforms. We aim to design cryptographic functions that promote this potential, thus minimizing the development effort required for adding new functionality or adapting to different platforms.

We have been analyzing the potential use of Rust or KMM to build the Apollo module.  4.1 Advantages of KMM​  Easier to have same interface for the cryptographic functionalities in all platforms Single Unit test suit to verify platform compatibility between platforms Version lock for supported library versions Less pron to compatibility errors between platforms When a new Platform is added to KMM we can easily test and verify with our code quality standards, if it passes we can add a new platform support  4.2 Disadvantages of KMM​  KMM is very powerful but still has some issues the more complex the project is, in Apollo it should be quite straightforward High dependency on a single point of failure (This can be advantage and disadvantage)  4.3 Advantage of KMM against rust​  KMM in this situation has great advantageous against Rust It might be more difficult to find libraries in Rust that can do all we require for all the platforms.

Anyone inquiring about the features or algorithms we support will have a clear and accessible resource to answer their questions. We plan to provide a complete list of features that Apollo offers, document them, and make this information accessible to everyone. Apollo will fully document its public APIs in terms of cryptography, compliance, supported algorithms, and key curves. While TypeScript could temporarily survive without WASM, we would significantly benefit from offering native performance for cryptographic libraries through WASM for browsers. Apollo will be tested using best practices, and over time we aim to raise the minimum test coverage threshold. Best practices and quality assurance will be addressed in a collaborative way between Cryptography and engineering, Cryptography engineers will be in charge of making sure our security is robust enough and properly tested and potentially helping us drive unit testing better.

It is also important to note that Option 2 isn't significantly more challenging to implement, so we shouldn't overly prioritize this consideration.  One potential drawback of Option 1 is that the size of the status list could potentially become too large, leading to slower verification due to the increased payload of the verification status list credential. However, it's worth noting that the verification status list credential is gZipped. This means that consecutive 0s and 1s will be compressed. For example, a sequence of 5 zeros (00000) will be stored as 5(0), indicating five consecutive zeros. Assuming that most credentials won't be revoked and will have an index of 0 in the status list, the gzipped status list in the status list credential should be very compact. This is the most crucial factor to consider in the end.  Option 2​  Option 2 slightly reduces privacy compared to Option 1 in certain scenarios. For example, in cases where the number of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) starts small but grows over time. Initially, both options face the same issue with a small anonymity set due to the limited number of VCs issued. As the number of VCs increases, Option 1 maintains a continuously growing anonymity set. However, in Option 2, when the issuer reaches the 16KB limit and creates a new list, there will be a period where the new list has only a few VCs, resulting in a smaller anonymity set for VCs in the second list.  Option 2 however, has a big advantage considering upcoming need for AnonCreds revocation. AnonCreds doesn't allow for expanding the status list size once defined during revocation registry creation. Pushing back Option 2 for AnonCreds and starting with an initial capacity of 1 million credentials may not be efficient. The size of the attached TAILS FILE grows rapidly with capacity (e.g., 8.4MB for 32,768 VCs!). This file needs to be resolved/downloaded by the holder during the issuance process.

It is more challenging when a problem is identified significantly later or in a different location from where it originated, involving collaboration among various parties for a solution. For DIDComm, the aspect of interoperability is especially critical in the context of problem reporting. In DIDComm, an agent developed by one team is required to be adept at interpreting errors reported by an agent from a completely different team, presenting a unique challenge in this area.  As of the time of writing, the Cloud Agent supports 3 DIDComm flows: Connection, Issuance and Verification.Each Cloud Agent operates a background thread that facilitates interactions between two agents. For each flow, the agent tracks a protocol state, and depending on this state, it triggers a DIDComm(V2) message to communicate with the other agent. The communication between two agents, Agent A and Agent B, occurs asynchronously in the background job. If an error occurs in this background job over DIDComm in Agent A, it is recorded in Agent A's logs. However, Agent B remains uninformed about any such errors.

However, effectively handling errors within the context of ZIO presents challenges that must be addressed.  Within our software development projects utilising ZIO, the management and handling of errors have emerged as areas requiring more clarity and strategy. The existing practices have shown limitations in terms of their efficiency and comprehensiveness.  The key issues are:  Lack of Consistent Error Handling Strategies: There's inconsistency in error handling across different modules and components of our ZIO-based applications, making it challenging to maintain a unified approach.Understanding and Communicating Errors: There's a need for a clearer method to categorise errors and communicate these effectively within the team and across various layers, facilitating quicker identifications and resolutions.Optimising Error Recovery Mechanisms: While ZIO provides powerful abstractions for error recovery, there's a necessity to optimise these mechanisms to ensure graceful degradation and resilience in our applications.  This ADR aims to explore and define strategies for utilising ZIO's capabilities more effectively in handling errors. It will outline decision drivers, available options, their pros and cons, and ultimately, the recommended approach to enhance our error management practices with the ZIO framework.  Effective management of errors directly impacts the reliability, maintainability, and customer experience of our applications.  By addressing the challenges of consistent error handling, we aim to enhance the stability of our products, ensuring reduced downtime, clearer communication with customers through structured error messages, and quicker issue resolution.  This not only improves the overall customer experience but also accelerates feature delivery as developers can focus more on implementing new functionalities rather than troubleshooting ad-hoc errors. The resulting streamlined development process contributes to cost reduction and optimised resource allocation.  In essence, these efforts are customer-centric, aiming to deliver a reliable, efficient, and customer-friendly service interface that positively impacts the overall customer experience and product adoption.

Enhancing the robustness of our applications will improve their resilience in adverse conditions.Traceability and Debugging: Reducing debugging time and efforts associated with error resolution is another driving factor. An efficient error-handling strategy should enable traceability and quicker identification, communication, and resolution of errors.User Experience and Reliability: Improving the quality and clarity of error messages reported to our users is a key driver. We aim to refine error messages to enable users to better understand what’s going on and respond to issues, thereby enhancing the user experience and the overall reliability of our applications.Alignment with Best Practices: Aligning our error-handling strategies with industry best practices and leveraging the full potential of ZIO's error management features is a driver.

This segregation should be done according to the principles outlined in the ZIO Types of Errors documentation section. That is, carefully distinguishing between:  ZIO Failures The expected/recoverable errors (i.e. domain-specific errors).Declared in the Error channel of the effect =&gt; ZIO[R, E, A].Supposed to be handled by the caller to prevent call stack propagation. ZIO Defects The unexpected/unrecoverable errors.Not represented in the ZIO effect.We do NOT expect the caller to handle them.Propagated throughout the call stack until converted to a Failure or logged for traceability and debugging purposes by the uppermost layer.  Use ADT to Model ZIO Failures​  Use Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) to model domain-specific errors as ZIO failures within the component/service interface.  Implementation tips:  Use a sealed trait or abstract class to represent the hierarchy of ZIO Failures, allowing for a well-defined set of error possibilities.Define specific error cases within the companion object of the sealed trait. This practice prevents potential conflicts when importing errors with common names (e.g. RecordNotFoundError), allowing users to prefix them with the name of the parent sealed trait for better code clarity.  Example:  sealed trait DomainError object DomainError { final case class BusinessLogicError(message: String) extends DomainError final case class DataValidationError(message: String) extends DomainError }   Use Scala 3 Union Types to Be More Specific About ZIO Failure Types​  Using the Scala 3 Union Types feature to declare the expected failures of a ZIO effect should be preferred over using the broader and more generic top-level sealed trait. This allows for a more explicit and detailed definition of potential failure scenarios and enhances error handling accuracy on the caller side.  This principle is outlined in the following section of the ZIO Error Management Best Practices documentation.  Example:  trait MyService { def myMethod(): ZIO[Any, BusinessLogicError | DataValidationError, Unit] }   Don’t Type Unexpected Errors (i.e. ZIO Defects)​  When we first discover typed errors, it may be tempting to put every error into the ZIO failure type parameter/channel. That is a mistake because we can't recover from all types of errors. When we encounter unexpected errors we can't do anything with, we should let the application die (i.e. the ZIO fiber). This is known as the “Let it Crash” principle, and it is a good approach for all unexpected errors.  This principle is outlined in the following section of the ZIO Error Management Best Practices documentation.

Any unhandled failures should be transformed into defects and propagated through the call stack. You should not expect callers of your component to handle lower-level failures that you do not handle.  Use Failure Wrappers To Prevent Failures Leakage From Lower Layers​  Do not directly expose their failure types in your component interface when invoking lower-level components. Use wrappers to encapsulate and abstract failure types originating from lower-level components, thus enhancing loose coupling and safeguarding against leakage of underlying implementation details to the caller.  Using failure wrappers and propagating them should not be the default strategy. Lower-level failures should primarily be managed at your component implementation level, ensuring that it appropriately handles and recovers them.  Failures not handled within the component's boundaries should preferably be transformed into defects whenever possible.  Do not reflexively log errors​  Avoid catching a ZIO failure or defect solely for the purpose of logging it. Instead, consider allowing the error to propagate through the call stack. It's preferable to assume that the uppermost layer, commonly known as 'the end of the world' will handle the logging of those errors. This practice promotes a centralised and consistent logging approach for better traceability and debugging.  This principle is outlined in the following section of the ZIO Error Management Best Practices documentation.  Adopt The “Let it Crash” Principle For ZIO Defects​  Adopt the “Let it Crash” principle for ZIO defects. Let them bubble up the call stack and crash the current ZIO fiber.

Doobie will report any database error as a subclass of Throwable, and its specific type will be directly linked to the underlying database implementation (i.e. PostgreSQL). Handling it this way means there is no deterministic way to recover from an SQL execution error in a database-agnostic way.  A good approach is to use ZIO Defects to report repository errors, declaring all repository methods as URIOor UIO(example). Conversely, declaring them as Task assumes that the caller (i.e. service) can properly handle and recover from the low-level and database-specific exceptions exposed in the error channel, which is a fallacy.  trait ConnectionRepository { def findAll: URIO[WalletAccessContext, Seq[ConnectionRecord]] }   Converting a ZIO Task to ZIO UIO can easily be done using ZIO#orDie(example).  class JdbcConnectionRepository(xa: Transactor[ContextAwareTask], xb: Transactor[Task]) extends ConnectionRepository { override def findAll: URIO[WalletAccessContext, Seq[ConnectionRecord]] = { val cxnIO = sql&quot;&quot;&quot; | SELECT | id, | created_at, | ... | FROM public.connection_records | ORDER BY created_at &quot;&quot;&quot;.stripMargin .query[ConnectionRecord] .to[Seq] cxnIO .transactWallet(xa) .orDie } }   For those cases where one has to generate a defect, a common way to do this is by using the following ZIO construct (example):  class JdbcConnectionRepository(xa: Transactor[ContextAwareTask], xb: Transactor[Task]) extends ConnectionRepository { override def getById(recordId: UUID): URIO[WalletAccessContext, ConnectionRecord] = for { maybeRecord &lt;- findById(recordId) record &lt;- ZIO.fromOption(maybeRecord).orDieWith(_ =&gt; RuntimeException(s&quot;Record not found: $recordId&quot;)) } yield record }   Apply the get vs find pattern​  Follow the get and find best practices in the repository interface for read operations:  getXxx() returns the requested record or throws an unexpected exception/defect when not found (example).findXxx() returns an Option with or without the request record, which allows the caller service to handle the foundand not-found cases and report appropriately to the end user (example).  trait ConnectionRepository { def findById(recordId: UUID): URIO[WalletAccessContext, Option[ConnectionRecord]] def getById(recordId: UUID): URIO[WalletAccessContext, ConnectionRecord] }   Do not return the affected row count​  The create, update or delete repository methods should not return an Int indicating the number of rows affected by the operation but either return Unit when successful or throw an exception/defect when the row count is not what is expected, like i.e. an update operation resulting in a 0 affected row count (example).  class JdbcConnectionRepository(xa: Transactor[ContextAwareTask], xb: Transactor[Task]) extends ConnectionRepository { override def create(record: ConnectionRecord): URIO[WalletAccessContext, Unit] = { val cxnIO = sql&quot;&quot;&quot; | INSERT INTO public.connection_records( | id, | created_at, | ... | ) values ( | ${record.id}, | ${record.createdAt}, | ... | ) &quot;&quot;&quot;.stripMargin.update cxnIO.run .transactWallet(xa) .ensureOneAffectedRowOrDie } } extension[Int](ma: RIO[WalletAccessContext, Int]) { def ensureOneAffectedRowOrDie: URIO[WalletAccessContext, Unit] = ma.flatMap { case 1 =&gt; ZIO.unit case count =&gt; ZIO.fail(RuntimeException(s&quot;Unexpected affected row count: $count&quot;)) }.orDie }   Do not reflexively log errors​  The upper layer will automatically do so appropriately and consistently using Tapir interceptor customization.

Following the above rules, the update method will throw a defect that will be caught at the upper level and returns a generic 500 Internal Server Error to the user.  For those cases where a specific error like 404 should be returned, it is up to the service to first call find()before update() and construct a NotFound failure, propagated through the error channel, if it gives a None (example).  Relying on the service layer to implement it will guarantee consistent behavior regardless of the underlying database type (could be different RDMS flavor, No-SQL, etc.).  class ConnectionServiceImpl() extends ConnectionService { override def markConnectionRequestSent(recordId: UUID): ZIO[WalletAccessContext, RecordIdNotFound | InvalidStateForOperation, ConnectionRecord] = for { maybeRecord &lt;- connectionRepository.findById(recordId) record &lt;- ZIO.fromOption(maybeRecord).mapError(_ =&gt; RecordIdNotFound(recordId)) updatedRecord &lt;- updateConnectionProtocolState( recordId, ProtocolState.ConnectionRequestPending, ProtocolState.ConnectionRequestSent ) } yield updatedRecord }   Do not type unexpected errors​  Do not wrap defects from lower layers (typically repository) in a failure and error case class declarations like thisshould be prohibited.  Considering that failures are viewed as expected errors from which users can potentially recover, error case classes like UnexpectedError should be prohibited (example).  Extend the common Failure trait​  Make sure all service errors extend the shared trait org.hyperledger.identus.shared.models.Failure. This allows handling &quot;at the end of the world“ to be done in a consistent and in generic way.  Create an exhaustive and meaningful list of service errors and make sure the value of the userFacingMessage attribute is chosen wisely! It will present &quot;as is&quot; to the user and should not contain any sensitive data (example).  trait Failure { val statusCode: StatusCode val userFacingMessage: String } sealed trait ConnectionServiceError( val statusCode: StatusCode, val userFacingMessage: String ) extends Failure object ConnectionServiceError { final case class InvitationAlreadyReceived(invitationId: String) extends ConnectionServiceError( StatusCode.BadRequest, s&quot;The provided invitation has already been used: invitationId=$invitationId&quot; ) }   User Input Validation​  Enforcing user input validation (business invariants) should primarily sit at the service layer and be implemented using theZIO Prelude framework.  While partially implementing user input validation at the REST entry point level via OpenAPI specification, it is crucial to enforce validation at the service level as well. This implementation ensures consistency and reliability across all interfaces that may call our services, recognizing that REST may not be the sole interface interacting with our services.  class ConnectionServiceImpl() extends ConnectionService { def validateInputs( label: Option[String], goalCode: Option[String], goal: Option[String] ): IO[UserInputValidationError, Unit] = { val validation = Validation .validate( ValidationUtils.validateLengthOptional(&quot;label&quot;, label, 0, 255), ValidationUtils.validateLengthOptional(&quot;goalCode&quot;, goalCode, 0, 255), ValidationUtils.validateLengthOptional(&quot;goal&quot;, goal, 0, 255) ) .unit ZIO.fromEither(validation.toEither).mapError(UserInputValidationError.apply) } }   Modeling validation errors should use a dedicated error case class and, when possible, provide validation failure details. One could use a construct like the following:  sealed trait ConnectionServiceError( val statusCode: StatusCode, val userFacingMessage: String ) extends Failure object ConnectionServiceError { final case class UserInputValidationError(errors: NonEmptyChunk[String]) extends ConnectionServiceError( StatusCode.BadRequest, s&quot;The provided input failed validation: errors=${errors.mkString(&quot;[&quot;, &quot;], [&quot;, &quot;]&quot;)}&quot; ) }   Use Scala 3 Union Types​  Use Scala 3 union-types declaration in the effect’s error channel to notify the caller of potential failures (example)  class ConnectionServiceImpl() extends ConnectionService { override def receiveConnectionRequest(request: ConnectionRequest, expirationTime: Option[Duration] = None): ZIO[WalletAccessContext, ThreadIdNotFound | InvalidStateForOperation | InvitationExpired, ConnectionRecord] = ??? }   Do not reflexively log errors​  The upper layer will automatically do so appropriately and consistently using Tapir interceptor customization.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"PRISM Node","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/documentation/learn/components/prism-node/","content":"PRISM Node The PRISM Node acts as a second-layer node for the Distributed Ledger. It functions as a verifiable data registry, providing a secure and reliable way to store and manage data. PRISM Node's primary purpose is to provide a secure and trustworthy platform for storing and managing data on the Distributed Ledger. By leveraging the blockchain's security and decentralization, the PRISM Node stores and retrieves data in a secure and immutable manner. All operations are independently verified and authenticated using cryptographic signatures and other security measures, so all data is accurate and trustworthy. The PRISM Node runs alongside a blockchain. It keeps the internal state synchronized with the underlying blockchain and indexed for efficient lookup operations. Furthermore, it implements did:prism method in an efficient and scalable way by publishing transactions to the Distributed Ledger. These transactions support the PRISM Node's protocol and perform the creation, update, resolution, and deactivation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs). The PRISM Node generates a transaction with information about the DID operation and verifies and validates the DID operation before publishing it to the blockchain. Once the transaction gets confirmed on the blockchain, the PRISM Node updates its internal state to reflect the changes. The second-layer PRISM Node also plays a critical role in resolving DIDs. Because the PRISM Node keeps the internal state indexed, it allows retrieving information about a particular DID quickly and efficiently without requiring access to the underlying blockchain. Overall, second-layer nodes are essential for the PRISM Node protocol, providing the necessary off-chain processing and data storage capabilities to make DIDs scalable and efficient. At its core, PRISM depends on protocols defining how to manage decentralized identifiers and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). The PRISM Node is the main component that implements these protocols. First, we should explain how the protocol works to understand what the PRISM Node does. Any user can run a PRISM Node to self-validate information or rely on a set of actors that run nodes on his behalf. The level of delegation of trust is a decision made by each user.Any user willing to create a DID can do so without any need to interact with any PRISM Node. Creating a DID can be optionally announced publicly by publishing a creation operation on-chain. The action of posting an operation on-chain does require interaction with a PRISM Node.Users can update the DID documents associated with their DIDs. To do this, they must publish respective update operations on-chain by interacting with a PRISM Node.Deactivating a DID can be performed along the same lines as an update by publishing a deactivation operation.PRISM Nodes read the operations published on-chain (by possibly other nodes) and internally maintain the map of DIDs to the history of changes of their associated DID documents.Clients can query any PRISM Node and obtain a DID's historical change log information.DID resolvers can take the output of PRISM Nodes and construct the current DID document associated with a DID.An additional consideration is that operations can be posted on-chain in blocks, helping on the scalability side and general reduction of fees. Additionally, the node provides an interface to track the status of operations submitted to a PRISM Node.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Why Identity","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/documentation/learn/identity","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Why Identity","url":"/docs/documentation/learn/identity#self-sovereign-identity-ssi","content":" SSI introduces new concepts that flip the existing identity models.

To run it on Cardano, you must set the NODE_LEDGER environment variable to cardano. If you do this, Node will utilize the Cardano wallet backend and DB-sync to query for blocks and submit transactions. It is crucial to have the Cardano wallet backend and DB-sync running before running the Node with NODE_LEDGER set to cardano.  Most up-to-date instructions on how to run the Cardano wallet backend and DB-sync are available in their respective repositories:  Cardano wallet backendDB-sync  Once you have these services up and running, specify their respective URLs in the environment variables of the Node:  Cardano wallet backend NODE_CARDANO_WALLET_API_HOST for wallet server hostNODE_CARDANO_WALLET_API_PORT for wallet server portNODE_CARDANO_WALLET_ROUTING_HEADER_NAME for wallet routing header name DB-sync NODE_CARDANO_DB_SYNC_HOST for DB-sync host and port in a format host:portNODE_CARDANO_DB_SYNC_DATABASE the databse name in DB-sync postgres databaseNODE_CARDANO_DB_SYNC_USERNAME DB-sync Database usernameNODE_CARDANO_DB_SYNC_PASSWORD DB-sync Database password  When running the Node with Cardano ledger, you must specify which network to use, either mainnet or testnet, using the NODE_CARDANO_NETWORK environment variable. While this environment variable is essential for the correct operation of the Node, it does not define the usable network. As mentioned earlier, the interface communicates with the Cardano node; subsequently, the network is DB-sync and Cardano wallet backend. Therefore, when configuring those services, you must specify the network used in their respective configurations. It is possible to run DB-sync on testnet, and Cardano wallet backend on mainnet, and select either one via NODE_CARDANO_NETWORK. The Node won't report any errors, but this configuration would be incorrect and won't work correctly. You are responsible for syncing these three components. If you intend to use the testnet, set NODE_CARDANO_NETWORK to the testnet, but also run Cardano wallet backend connected to the testnet and start DB-sync to sync from the Node that is also running on the testnet as well. The same goes with mainnet.  Apart from that, you must also provide the Wallet ID and its spending password as environment variables as well:  NODE_CARDANO_WALLET_ID - The wallet ID must be in hex-encoded format, and the wallet must belong to the network you are running the Node on, which can be either testnet or mainnetNODE_CARDANO_WALLET_PASSPHRAS - Spending password or wallet above  The Node utilizes Cardano as a decentralized open database, and its implementation is similar to the DIF Sidetree Protocol. In short, the Node stores all relevant information in a Cardano transaction metadata and sends 1 ADA (minimum allowed amount) to another address, which you must provide via the NODE_CARDANO_PAYMENT_ADDRESS environment variable, which will store arbitrary information on the blockchain. In most cases, you don't need to specify a particular address for sending transactions as long as the transaction gets recorded. In this case, you should set NODE_CARDANO_PAYMENT_ADDRESS to the same address you are sending transactions from, NODE_CARDANO_WALLET_ID. In this configuration, you are not spending any ADA other than the transaction fee for every transaction. Suppose your wallet does not have enough ADA to cover the transaction fee (plus 1 ADA to send to yourself). In that case, the transaction won't get recorded, and your operation, which includes any DID-related action, won't be submitted.  The last component is the database that the Node uses internally to index Identus cloud agent related Cardano transactions and maintain the state of DID documents. It is a simple PostgreSQL version 13 database, and you can use the Docker image postgres:13 to run it.  When running the Node, you must specify the host, database name, username, and password of this database via environment variables.  NODE_PSQL_HOST - host with a port, in a format host:portNODE_PSQL_DATABASE - database nameNODE_PSQL_USERNAME - usernameNODE_PSQL_PASSWORD - password  The Node gRPC server has three dependencies: Node DB, Cardano wallet, and DB-sync. You need to run these three services before starting the Node.  Node DB is a simple PostgreSQL database.  Cardano wallet is an application that communicates with the Cardano network; it functions as a server that you can start and connect to either the mainnet or testnet. You must provide the Node runnable's host and port as environment variables.  DB-sync is an application responsible for syncing the Cardano blockchain with a PostgreSQL database. It would help if you used it to sync with either the mainnet or testnet and must provide the database host with port, database name, and credentials as environment variables to the Node runnable.

Refer to the Concepts and Components sections for a more in-depth explanation.  The trust triangle is the most basic process for conveying trust in the digital world. There are three roles in an SSI ecosystem: Holders, Issuers, and Verifiers.    Holders can be any entity, such as individuals, organizations, and digital or physical things. They will hold verifiable credentials (VCs) and use a verifiable presentation to share their VCs.  Issuers can also be any entity that makes claims about an entity. These claims are attestations, or evidence of something, about the Holder. As an example, an insurance company would provide proof of valid insurance.  Verifiers are the relying party in the triangle. They will request information from the Holder, such as proof of insurance, and the Holder will use a verifiable presentation to share the appropriate VCs with the Verifier.

not affect you, except if you weren't relying on the Agent but using the internals directly for some things. ### feat: making didcomm plugin (#425) BREAKING CHANGE: Revocation handling is no longer automatic What Changed: DIDComm functionality has been refactored into a plugin architectureCredential revocation notifications are no longer handled automatically by the SDKRevocation messages must now be explicitly passed to the agent.handle() function for processingMajor reorganization of DIDComm-related code into src/plugins/internal/didcomm/ and src/plugins/internal/oea/Connection management protocols (MediateDeny, MediateGrant, PickupDelivery, etc.) moved to plugin structureProtocol types and invitation handlers restructured Migration Required: Update code that expects automatic revocation handling to explicitly call agent.handle() with revocation messagesReview any custom integrations with DIDComm protocols as file paths and module structures have changedIf using Out-of-Band (OOB) invitations or presentation protocols, verify imports from new plugin locations Files Changed: 89 files (630 insertions, 590 deletions) ### feat!: Anoncreds moving to plugin export (#420) BREAKING CHANGE: Anoncreds is no longer included in the core SDK bundle What Changed: Anoncreds functionality has been extracted from the core SDK bundle into a separate pluginAnoncreds is no longer exported by default from the main SDKA new plugin system entry point has been created at src/plugins/internal/anoncreds/plugin.tsAnoncreds must now be explicitly loaded as a plugin if neededThis significantly reduces the core bundle size for applications that don't use Anoncreds Migration Required: Import and register the Anoncreds plugin explicitly in your application: import { AnoncredsPlugin } from '@atala/prism-wallet-sdk/plugins' // Register plugin with your agent configuration Update any imports that previously expected Anoncreds to be available by defaultE2E tests updated to show plugin registration pattern ### feat!: updating DIDComm connection protocols (#400) BREAKING CHANGE: Removed HandshakeRequest.safeParseBody method What Changed: The HandshakeRequest.safeParseBody static method has been completely removedProtocol parsing logic has been refactored and centralizedChanges to how connection protocols handle message body parsingUpdates to MediationKeysUpdateList, PickupReceived, PickupRequest, and RevocationNotification protocolsProtocol types file has been cleaned up (removed 26 lines of unused types) Migration Required: Replace any calls to HandshakeRequest.safeParseBody() with the new parsing mechanismReview connection establishment code for any dependencies on the removed methodUpdate tests that relied on safeParseBody functionality feat(Pluto)!: updating Pluto to extend Startable (#399) BREAKING CHANGE: Pluto.stop() is now a required method What Changed: The Pluto interface now extends the Startable interfaceAll Pluto implementations must now provide a stop() method for proper cleanupThe stop() method was previously optional but is now mandatoryThis ensures consistent lifecycle management across all storage implementationsRxDB Store implementation updated to properly implement the stop() method Migration Required: If you have a custom Pluto implementation, you must implement the stop() methodThe stop() method should handle cleanup of database connections, event listeners, and any other resourcesUpdate initialization code to call pluto.stop() during application shutdown or cleanupExample implementation: async stop(): Promise&lt;void&gt; { // Clean up database connections // Remove event listeners // Close any open resources } ### feat!: updating DIDComm other protocols (#397) BREAKING CHANGE: Protocol helper methods removed and message handling refactored What Changed: Removed 51 lines of protocol helper functions from ProtocolHelpers.tsBasicMessage protocol simplified (reduced from more complex implementation)ProblemReport protocol significantly refactored (84 lines changed)OutOfBandInvitation and PrismOnboardingInvitation protocol handling updatedRemoved 24 lines of type definitions from protocol types fileOverall simplification and cleanup of protocol handling code Migration Required: Review any code using BasicMessage or ProblemReport protocolsUpdate OutOfBand invitation handling if you have custom implementationsCheck for any dependencies on removed helper functions from ProtocolHelpers fix!: refactor JWK implementation into a pollux task (#386) BREAKING CHANGE: Removed KeyProperties.type field from Apollo key management What Changed: The KeyProperties.type field has been completely removedThis field previously stored curve type information (e.g., &quot;Curve25519&quot;, &quot;EC&quot;)Curve type information is now determined automatically from other key propertiesNew JWK (JSON Web Key) utilities added to Pollux at src/pollux/utils/jwt/FromJWK.ts (145 new lines)Apollo key creation simplified - no longer needs or accepts the type parameterExtensive new test coverage added for JWK functionality (253 lines of tests) Migration Required: Remove any code that sets KeyProperties.type when creating keys with ApolloThe type field will be silently ignored if provided, but should be removed from your codeIf you have custom key creation logic, verify it works without the type parameterExample migration: // Before: apollo.createPrivateKey({ type: &quot;EC&quot;, curve: &quot;secp256k1&quot;, ... }) // After: apollo.createPrivateKey({ curve: &quot;secp256k1&quot;, ... }) ### feat!: refactor ConnectionManager (#394) BREAKING CHANGE: Major Agent API changes - removed connection management from constructor What Changed: Removed connectionManager parameter from Agent constructorRemoved mediationHandler parameter from Agent constructorRemoved PlutoMediatorStore from public exportsDeleted entire ConnectionsManager class (304 lines removed)Deleted BasicMediatorHandler class (263 lines removed)Deleted PlutoMediatorStore class (43 lines removed)Connection management now handled internally through new architecture: New ConnectionsManager implementation (86 lines)New Connection and JobManager classesDIDComm connection handling moved to dedicated modules New standalone functions: StartFetchingMessages and StartMediatorRemoved MediationGrant and PickupRunner protocols (replaced with new implementations) Migration Required: Agent Initialization: Remove connectionManager and mediationHandler from Agent constructor // Before: const agent = Agent.initialize({ connectionManager: myConnectionManager, mediationHandler: myMediationHandler, // ... other options }) // After: const agent = Agent.initialize({ // ... other options (connection management is now internal) }) The Agent now manages connections internally - no need to provide external connection managementIf you extended or customized BasicMediatorHandler or PlutoMediatorStore, you'll need to refactor to use the new internal APIsReview any code that imported ConnectionsManager, MediatorHandler, or PlutoMediatorStore types ### feat!: updating DIDComm presentation protocols (#383) BREAKING CHANGE: Removed static factory methods from presentation protocol classes What Changed: Removed Methods: Presentation.makePresentationFromRequest() - removedProposePresentation.makeProposalFromRequest() - removedRequestPresentation.makeRequestFromProposal() - removedProofTypes interface - removed entirely Removed 93 lines of helper functions from ProtocolHelpers.tsPresentation, ProposePresentation, and RequestPresentation classes refactored to remove convenience factory methodsProtocol construction now requires explicit instantiation with all required parametersTest files significantly updated to reflect new construction patterns Migration Required: Replace factory method calls with direct class construction: // Before: const presentation = Presentation.makePresentationFromRequest(request, credentials) const proposal = ProposePresentation.makeProposalFromRequest(request) const request = RequestPresentation.makeRequestFromProposal(proposal) // After: const presentation = new Presentation({ // explicitly provide all required fields }) Update any code using the ProofTypes interfaceReview presentation protocol flows to ensure all required fields are provided during construction ### feat: update DIDComm json message types (#375) BREAKING CHANGE: AttachmentDescriptor now only accepts bodies with json property What Changed: Tightened type safety for AttachmentDescriptor.bodyThe body of an AttachmentDescriptor must now explicitly include a json propertyRemoved support for other body formats in AttachmentDescriptorMessage attachment handling simplified in Mercury wrapper (36 lines reduced)Added comprehensive test coverage for message attachments (47 new test lines)This aligns with DIDComm v2 specification requirements Migration Required: Ensure all message attachments use the json property in their body: // Before (may have worked): const attachment = { data: { base64: encodedData } } // After (required): const attachment = { data: { json: jsonData // Must use json property } } Review any custom message creation code that uses attachmentsUpdate tests that create AttachmentDescriptor instances ### feat!: updating DIDComm protocols closer to specification (#373) BREAKING CHANGE: Removed static factory methods from credential issuance protocols What Changed: Removed Methods: IssueCredential.build() - removedIssueCredential.makeIssueFromRequestCredential() - removedOfferCredential.build() - removedOfferCredential.makeOfferFromProposedCredential() - removed Protocol construction now requires explicit parameter specificationExtensive test updates to reflect new construction patterns Migration Required: Replace factory method calls with direct class construction: // Before: const offer = OfferCredential.build() const issue = IssueCredential.makeIssueFromRequestCredential(request) // After: const offer = new OfferCredential({ // explicitly provide all required fields from: did, to: recipientDid, body: credentialBody, // ... other required fields }) Update credential issuance flows to explicitly construct protocol messagesReview test files for examples of the new construction patterns ### feat(Pollux)!: plugins (#349) BREAKING CHANGE: Complete architectural overhaul - Pollux class removed, plugin system introduced What Changed:This is the largest breaking change in this release, fundamentally restructuring how credential operations work: Pollux Class Removed: The entire Pollux class (1,355 lines) has been removed Plugin System Introduced: All credential functionality moved to plugin-based architecture Three Main Plugin Categories: Anoncreds Plugin (src/plugins/internal/anoncreds/) CredentialIssue, CredentialOffer, PresentationRequest, PresentationVerifyAnoncredsLoader module (220 lines)Must be explicitly loaded if Anoncreds support is needed DIF (Decentralized Identity Foundation) Plugin (src/plugins/internal/dif/) IsCredentialRevoked, PresentationRequest, PresentationVerifyCreatePresentationDefinition moduleHandles DIF Presentation Exchange protocol OEA (OpenID for Verifiable Credentials) Plugin (src/plugins/internal/oea/) JWT and SD-JWT credential supportCredentialIssue, CredentialOffer, PresentationRequest for both formats Agent Constructor Changes: Removed mediationHandler parameter (no longer required)Removed connectionManager parameter (no longer required)Agent initialization significantly simplified New Core Infrastructure: Plugin system with Plugin interface and PluginManager (36 + 30 lines)Task-based architecture for credential operations (src/utils/tasks.ts)Protocol payload handling improved (src/domain/protocols/Payload.ts) Credential Model Changes: VerifiableCredential class streamlined (466 lines reduced)JWT and SD-JWT credential models refactoredNew utility modules in src/pollux/utils/jwt/ Removed Utilities: src/domain/utils/hash.ts (26 lines removed)src/domain/utils/randomBytes.ts (8 lines removed)Various Pollux utils consolidated into plugin-specific implementations Migration Required: Remove Pollux Initialization: // Before: const pollux = new Pollux(...) const agent = Agent.initialize({ pollux, mediationHandler: handler, connectionManager: manager, // ... }) // After: const agent = Agent.initialize({ // pollux, mediationHandler, connectionManager no longer needed // ... }) Load Required Plugins:This is just an example on how the SDK can be extended with new DIDComm protocols, allowing you to customize your own flows but is not require for most implementations that are using the Agent export. import { AnoncredsPlugin } from '@atala/prism-wallet-sdk/plugins/anoncreds' import { DIFPlugin } from

agent.registerPlugin(OEAPlugin) Update Credential Operations: Credential issuance, verification, and presentation operations now go through the plugin systemThe Agent will automatically route operations to the appropriate plugin based on credential typeNo need to call Pollux methods directly anymore Update Imports: Many internal types are no longer exportedImport credential types from the main SDK exportPlugin-specific types available from plugin modules Review Custom Integrations: Any custom code extending or wrapping Pollux must be completely rewrittenUse the plugin interface to add

Component Setup and Helpers: The component uses React state to manage the DID, transaction status, and any potential errors.It uses the useWallet hook from @meshsdk/react to get the connected wallet's state and instance.splitStringIntoChunks is a helper function to correctly format the DID operation data for Cardano's transaction metadata.checkTransactionConfirmation is a helper to poll the Blockfrost API and verify when the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain. publishDid Function: This is the core logic, triggered by a button click. Initialization: It initializes the Apollo and Castor modules from the Atala PRISM SDK.DID Creation: It creates a new master private key and uses it to generate a new, unpublished did:prism.Metadata Preparation: It calls createPrismDIDAtalaObject to generate the specific data structure required for the publication operation. This data is then chunked for the metadata.Transaction with Mesh: It uses Mesh's Transaction builder, which provides a simple and elegant API. It sets the metadata for the transaction using the standard label for PRISM DID operations (21325).Signing and Submission: The transaction is built, signed by the user through their connected wallet, and submitted to the blockchain.Confirmation: The component then polls for confirmation and updates the UI to reflect the successful publication. User Interface: It renders Mesh's CardWallet component to allow users to easily connect their CIP30 wallet.Once connected, it displays a button to initiate the publishing process.It provides real-time feedback to the user, showing the created DID, transaction hash, and final confirmation status.  After the transaction is confirmed, your did:prism is published on the Cardano blockchain, and its short-form DID can be resolved by anyone.
